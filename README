OPTIONS

    --exclude=[!]name
            Exclude from the running thread list queries matching the
            argument. This parameter can be repeated several times to
            exclude different kinds of queries. If you prefix the argument
            with an exclamation mark (!), all thread not matching this
            argument will be excluded. Allowed parameters are:

            select, insert, replace, update, delete

            Exclude SQL query which command is of the same name.

            write

            Exclude every SQL query doing write operation (insert, replace,
            update, delete).

            other

            Exclude SQL query which are none of the above type.

            sleep

            Exclude all sleeping threads

            system

            Exclude thread ran by the system (often used for replication
            threads)

            user=<user>

            Exclude threads ran by given mysql username.

            db=<db>

            Exclude threads using given database.

            state=<state>

            Exclude threads in given state.

            See
            <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/general-thread-states.ht
            ml> for the list of possible states

            command=<command>

            Exclude threads using given command.

            See
            <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/thread-commands.html>
            for the list of possible commands.

    --selects-only
            This is equivalent to: --exclude=write --exclude=other
            --exclude=sleep --exclude=system.

    --min-time=#
            Exclude queries with execution time lower than given parameter.

    --timeout
            Keep only queries with a timeout provided and with an execution
            time which exceeded this timeout. The timeout can be provided
            with the query in a comment like this:

              SELECT /* timeout:40 */ * FROM table;

            Timeout is expressed in second.

    --limit=#
            Take first # threads and excludes others.

    --placeholder
            Will try to make queries more generic by replacing all values by
            either "i" for numbers or "s" for strings.

    --distinct
            Keep only the first query from group of identical queries and
            exlude others.

            Note: If you use this option with --placeholder, queries that
            would differ only by values used will become identical. This is
            useful to distinct big type of queries.

    --sort[=name]
            Sort matched queries by parameter given as argument.

            Allowed parameters are as follow:

            concurrency or c

            Sort queries by most repeated ones.

            time or t

            Sort queries by longer execution time.

    --list[=template]
            Output the result to the terminal.

            The default output format can be changed by supplying a template
            with desired field.

            Available fields are: Id, User, Command, State, Db, Host, Time,
            Info, Group, Concurrency, QType, Timeout

            Default template is: <Id> <User> <Db> <Time> <Info>

    --kill  Kill every threads that match the given filters.

    --stats Show statistics about queries matched by filters.

    --interval[=#]
            Repeat the command at regular interval. Interval in second can
            be specified as argument. If not specified, default interval is
            5 seconds.

DESCRIPTION
    mysql-genocide plays with MySQL processlist. It can filter it using
    different criterias like execution time, query type, user or regexp
    matching of the SQL query. Actions can then be peformed on the result
    like killing, sorting or generating statistics.

EXAMPLES
    Kill all selects with execution time geater than 60 seconds:

        mysql-genocide --selects-only --min-time 60 --kill

    Same as before but limited on queries matching a pattern:

        mysql-genocide -s -t 60 -K 'FROM user '

    Kill all queries timed out:

        mysql-genocide --timeout --kill

    Replace queries values by placeholders and group identical queries
    together, sort them by most concurrent and keep only the 10 most
    concurent ones:

        mysql-genocide --placeholder --group --sort concurrency --limit 10 --list
